### Steps for Solving the Inverse Kinematics Problem with the Corresponding Simulation Software

This program aims to solve the inverse kinematics problem by providing a user-friendly interface for inputting arm lengths and target positions, and visually simulating the movement of a robotic arm to reach the desired point within its work space.

1. **Initial Data Reading**: We need to read the basic data and parameters from the user. 
These include:
   - Lengths L1, L2 (ensure that the values are acceptable so that the robotic arm can be projected within the screen's width and height dimensions).
   - Clockwise or counter-clockwise direction for the final projection.
   - The coordinates x2, y2 of the end of the 2nd segment of the robotic arm (ensure that they are within the external boundary and outside the internal work envelope).

2. **Cartesian System Projection Routine**: We need a routine to project the Cartesian coordinate system with the horizontal X-axis and the vertical Y-axis, which will be located in the middle of the screen.

3. **Work Envelope Projection Routine**: We need a routine to project the internal and external work envelope.

4. **Solution Calculation Routine or Functions**: We need a routine or corresponding functions to calculate the two pairs of solutions (x1a,y1a & x1b,y1b), i.e., the counter-clockwise and clockwise solutions.

5. **Solution Discrimination**: We must be able to distinguish which of the two pairs of solutions represents the counter-clockwise and which the clockwise solution. Depending on the user's choice in the first step of data entry, we keep the corresponding pair and use it to finally project the robotic arm to the user.

6. **User Input for Movement**: Next, we need to ask the user for the coordinates xt,yt where they want the robotic arm to move (implying straight-line motion). We must repeatedly check that the coordinates given by the user define a feasible straight-line motion; otherwise, the program should inform the user and request new coordinates.

7. **Animation Process**: Once the program accepts "correct" coordinates, it will start an animation process, moving the robotic arm in a straight line from the initial to the final position.
